# Trip Forecaster project

<p>This application is my personal project designed to consolidate forecasts for my trips in one place. You can add and delete cities on the map to obtain current weather or a week-long forecast. Additionally, you can retrieve your current position and access additional information about cities from Wikipedia.

For the development of this application, I chose to use Redux Toolkit for learning purposes. However, it could be replaced with useContext or useRedux if needed.

To further enhance the functionality, this application can be improved by adding a login feature. This would enable users to personalize their experience and add additional information, like comments about city.</p>
